## GWEN
- Unofficial mirror of GWEN - GUI Without Extravagant Nonsense

## Major changes
- Image decoding through [stb_image library by Sean Barrett](http://nothings.org).
- Truetype font support through [stb_truetype library by Sean Barrett](http://nothings.org).
- FreeImage library removed.

## Major issues to fix
- Unicode strings are broken and wont render properly.
- Dirty and hack-ish implementation right now. Needs cleaning.
- Some truetype fonts make the app to crash (like Impact font).
