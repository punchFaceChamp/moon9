 What is it?
----------------------------------------
This program is an OpenGL demo which display an animated
md5mesh model.  md5mesh is the model format used in Doom3.
Animations are in separate *.md5anim files.

This demo has nothing to do with the MD5 cryptographic hash
function!

This demo has been developped under GNU/Linux and the win32
binary has been built with a cross compiler (MinGW). There
are 5 render paths:
  - No bump mapping, through fixed pipeline (if your hardware
    doesn't support shaders or ARB programs);
  - Bump mapping with diffuse component only, through ARB
    vertex and fragment programs;
  - Bump mapping with diffuse and specular components, through
    ARB vp & fp;
  - Bump mapping with diffuse/specular and parallax mapping,
    through ARB vp & fp;
  - Bump mapping with diffuse/specular and parallax mapping
    (optional), through GLSL.

You can use ARB programs if you have the following extensions:
  - GL_ARB_vertex_program
  - GL_ARB_fragment_program

You can use GLSL shader if you have the following extensions:
  - GL_ARB_shader_objects extension
  - GL_ARB_shading_language_100 extension
  - GL_ARB_vertex_shader extension
  - GL_ARB_fragment_shader extension

The bump mapping width diffuse and specular through ARB vp & fp
should be identical than through GLSL shader. However, the parallax
mapping gives different results...

Parallax mapping has been implemented for testing, but it doesn't
give better results here (or I wrongly implemented it). So it's
disabled by default.


 Building the source
----------------------------------------
See the INSTALL file.


 Running the demo
----------------------------------------
Under GNU/Linux, type './OpenGLMD5Loader' in the demo
directory. Under Windows, run OpenGLMD5Loader.exe.

The demo uses a little script file to know which model
and animations to load.  These files have the ".loader"
extension, but this is not an obligation.

The demo read the file passed in argument.  If none is
passed to the demo, the default.loader file is used.

You can pass a loader script or a .md5mesh file to the
program. Note: if you pass a .md5mesh file, the model
will neither be textured nor animated (you will just
have the meshes contained in the .md5mesh file).

The .loader script syntax is described below in this
readme file.


 Keyboard and mouse input
----------------------------------------
Keyboard:
 * 'F3': render path "fixed pipeline"
 * 'F4': render path "bump diffuse (ARB vp & fp)"
 * 'F5': render path "bump diffuse specular (ARB vp & fp)"
 * 'F6': render path "bump diffuse specular parallax (ARB vp & fp)"
 * 'F7': render path "bump diffuse specular parallax (GLSL)"
 * 'H': toggle GLSL shaders
 * 'P': toggle parallax offset (for GLSL shader only)
 * 'W': toggle wireframe/filled mode
 * 'S': toggle smooth/flat shaded mode (in FFP mode)
 * 'L': toggle light (in FFP mode)
 * 'N': toggle show normals
 * 'T': toggle texture 2D (in FFP mode)
 * 'K': toggle show model's skeleton
 * 'J': toggle show joint labels (if skeleton is drawn)
 * 'B': toggle show bounding box
 * 'C': toggle backface culling
 * 'SPACE': toggle pause animation
 * LEFT/RIGHT arrows: play previous/next animation
 * 'F1': toggle fullscreen/windowed mode (problematic under Windows)
 * 'ESCAPE': quit

Mouse:
 * left button: rotation
 * right button: zoom
 * button left + shift: translation


Known problems
----------------------------------------
Under Windows, resizing the window may behave strangely (lost
off all the textures, which are not reloaded). This is because
Windows sucks.

Under Windows, drag & dropping a file onto the executable does
not work (frankly, I don't know why). This is probably because
SDL sucks.

Under Windows, full screen doesn't work either. This is because
SDL sucks (sure).

Windows users are condemned to stuck in 640x480, or switch
to a real operating system :p


 loader script files' syntax
----------------------------------------
You can pass a file in parameter of the program in order
to use it instead of default.loader for loading MD5 model
and its animations.

Here is the syntax:
 * Loading a model:
   model "where/is/your/model/yourmodel.md5mesh"

 * Loading a texture:
   decalMap "name_of_the_mesh" "where/is/your/texture/yourtexture.tga"

   There is also specularMap, normalMap and heightMap commands.

 * Loading an animation:
   anim "where/is/your/anim/youranim.md5anim"

 * Hiding a mesh from the md5mesh file:
   hide "name_of_the_mesh"

 * Setting up default animation to play:
   setAnim "youranim"

You must first load a model.  You can set the animation
to play after having loaded the animation file, but it
has no effect if you do before.

The ".loader" extension is not necessary, you can give
a *.txt or *.foobar file if you want, provided it is a valid
script loader for the MD5 Viewer.

Mesh names ("name_of_the_mesh") are defined by the "shader"
variable in the .md5mesh files.  This is the shader string
without the path, i.e. the portion after the last '/'.
