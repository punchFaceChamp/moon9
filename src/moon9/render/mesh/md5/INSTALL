 Compiling under GNU/Linux
----------------------------------------
In a shell, go to the demo directory and type:
  'make'
or
  'make -f Makefile.linux'

You'll need to have these libraries with development
files installed on your system:
 * OpenGL
 * GLU
 * glext.h (the more recent you can)
 * libGLEW (>= 1.3.3)
 * libSDL
 * libSDL_ttf
 * zlib
 * libpng
 * libjpeg
 * boost

There is a copy of a glext.h file in the include/GL
directory.  You can copy it in your /usr/include/GL
directory if yours is older.

You can also build the win32 executable with MinGW
under GNU/Linux.  The Makefile.linux-mingw does
it (Debian/Ubuntu).


 Compiling under Windows with MinGW
----------------------------------------
In a shell, go to the demo directory and type:
  'make'
or
  'make -f Makefile.mingw'

All dependent libraries except boost are included
in the project, so you don't need to download them.

You can grab the boost library from http://www.boost.org/
